Machine learning models to classify spinal data.

<h1> Project </h1>
A couple of machine learning models I used to classify spinal data. 

The techniques I used were 
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- kNN
- XGBoost

The performance results 


<h1> Outcome </h1>
<br> - Accuracy of Random Forest Classifier 0.775862069 </br>
<br> - Accuracy of Naive Bayes 0.758620690 </br>
<br> - Accuracy of kNN 0.810344828 </br>
<br> - Accuracy of Gradient Boosting XGBoost 0.862068966 </br>
